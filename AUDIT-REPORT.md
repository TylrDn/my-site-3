# 🎯 MacroSight Deployment Audit & Fix Report

**Date**: July 31, 2025  
**Repository**: TylrDn/my-site-3  
**Branch**: main  
**Commit**: 36602fc

## 🔍 **AUDIT RESULTS**

### ✅ **ISSUES FOUND & FIXED**

#### 🔴 **CRITICAL**: CORS Headers Misconfiguration
- **Problem**: `embed.html` was receiving `access-control-allow-origin: https://www.macrosight.net` instead of `*`
- **Impact**: Wix embedding broken (cross-origin restrictions)
- **Fix**: Added specific `/embed.html` rule in `netlify.toml` with highest priority
- **Verification**: Headers now properly configured for embedding

#### 🟡 **MEDIUM**: File Naming Inconsistency
- **Problem**: `Invest _ Donate.tkf6g.js` had spaces and unclear naming
- **Fix**: Renamed to `Invest.tkf6g.js` for consistency
- **Impact**: Better maintainability and clarity

#### 🟡 **MEDIUM**: CI Testing Wrong Domain
- **Problem**: CI was testing staging URL instead of production
- **Fix**: Updated workflow to test `https://www.macrosight.net`
- **Impact**: More accurate deployment validation

### ✅ **CONFIRMED WORKING**

1. **Static File Structure**: All HTML files properly in `public/`, no JS files present ✅
2. **Wix Integration**: Proper separation of Velo code in `src/` ✅  
3. **postMessage Security**: Only `embed.html` has listeners, proper origin whitelist ✅
4. **Build Config**: Netlify correctly configured to publish `public/` folder ✅
5. **Integration Pattern**: All page JS files follow consistent pattern ✅

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION**

### **Netlify Headers (Fixed)**
```toml
# Specific rule for embed.html (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
[[headers]]
  for = "/embed.html"
  [headers.values]
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin = "*"

# General rule for other HTML files  
[[headers]]
  for = "/*.html"
  [headers.values]
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin = "*"
    [security headers...]

# Restrictive rule for assets
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin = "https://www.macrosight.net"
    [security headers...]
```

### **Security Maintained**
- HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options preserved ✅
- Only HTML files have open CORS ✅
- Assets remain domain-restricted ✅

## 🔧 **IMPROVEMENTS ADDED**

### **Documentation**
- `DEPLOY-CHECKLIST.md`: Step-by-step deployment validation
- Enhanced `README.md`: Better architecture overview with deployment status
- Improved code comments: Better maintainer guidance

### **CI/CD Enhancements**
- Production domain testing for accurate results
- Better error messages for CORS validation
- Enhanced reporting with specific failure reasons

## 🧪 **VERIFICATION COMMANDS**

After Netlify propagation (5-10 minutes), run:

```bash
# Test embed.html CORS (should return *)
curl -I https://www.macrosight.net/embed.html | grep access-control-allow-origin

# Test other HTML CORS (should return *)  
curl -I https://www.macrosight.net/home.html | grep access-control-allow-origin

# Test asset CORS (should return specific domain)
curl -I https://www.macrosight.net/styles.css | grep access-control-allow-origin

# Verify security headers
curl -I https://www.macrosight.net/home.html | grep -E "strict-transport-security|x-frame-options|content-security-policy"
```

## 📋 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Wait for Netlify propagation** (5-10 minutes)
2. **Run verification commands** above to confirm fixes
3. **Test Wix integration** in Editor Preview mode
4. **Monitor CI workflow** for successful validation

## 🎯 **EXPECTED OUTCOMES**

After these changes:
- ✅ Wix embedding should work without CORS errors
- ✅ Static pages remain secure with proper headers  
- ✅ CI validates actual deployment configuration
- ✅ Future updates follow documented patterns
- ✅ Maintainers have clear guidance and checklists
