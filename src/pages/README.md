# Usage with Wix Velo

## SEO & Launch Files

This site includes:
- `/robots.txt` (allows all, points to sitemap)
- `/sitemap.xml` (lists all public pages)

Both are in `/public` and will be live at the root of your deployed site for search engines and best practice.

All page scripts should import global styles like this for Wix/Velo compatibility:

```js
import { injectGlobalStyles } from "public/globalStyles";
```

Call `injectGlobalStyles()` at the top of your `$w.onReady()` function in each page script.

## 🧠 Site Structure

The site includes 7 primary content pages:

| Page             | File Name             | Purpose |
|------------------|------------------------|---------|
| Home             | `Home.c1dmp.js`        | Tagline, positioning, key CTAs |
| About            | `About.imh2g.js`       | Bio, values, strategic focus |
| Experience       | `Experience.g75d6.js`  | Career timeline & technical history |
| Projects         | `Projects.v2squ.js`    | Strategic + Technical portfolio showcase |
| Resume           | `Resume.ot8c3.js`      | PDF + summary of skills/capabilities |
| Contact          | `Contact.i6766.js`     | Form + CTA |
| Invest/Donate    | `Invest.tkf6g.js`      | Support/partnership invitation |

Shared logic and global styles are injected via:

- `masterPage.js`: shared layout behaviors (e.g. sticky header, footer year)
- `public/globalStyles.js`: centralized DOM-based CSS injection

## 🧩 How Wix Links Files to Pages

Each page file follows the pattern `PageName.uniqueId.js`, auto-generated by Wix.

- ✅ Do not rename these files manually
- ✅ Add/remove pages in the Wix Editor UI to sync with this repo

---

## 🎨 Styling Strategy

All UI styling is class-based and managed in `globalStyles.js`. This ensures:

- Consistent visual system across the site
- Responsive layouts (flex/grid)
- No inline style repetition

### Example Usage

```js
<div class="card">
  <h3>Title</h3>
  <p>Description here</p>
</div>
````

Injected using:

```js
import { injectGlobalStyles } from 'public/globalStyles';
```

## 🚀 Deployment Workflow

| Task           | Method                  |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Dev changes    | Local `.js` editing     |
| Apply to Wix   | Paste into Code Panel   |
| Track progress | Git commit / sync log   |
| Live updates   | Manual "Publish" in Wix |

## 📄 Notes

* All page UI is modular, injected via `.html = ...` and styled via `class=""`
* Avoid inline styles — extend `globalStyles.js` when needed
