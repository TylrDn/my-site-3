# Deployment Status

## Summary
Most infrastructure is working as expected. The remaining issue is CORS header
propagation for HTML files.

### Infrastructure checks
- Static files return 200 responses
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options) are present
- Wix integration moved to a web module
- Page code imports are correct

### Pending propagation
- CORS header still shows `access-control-allow-origin: https://www.macrosight.net`
- Expected header: `access-control-allow-origin: *`

## Timeline
- 11:26 PM – Updated CORS header configuration in `netlify.toml`
- 11:33 PM – Moved Wix integration to a web module
- 11:33 PM – Triggered rebuild to force propagation

## Current status
- Netlify build: successful
- CDN propagation: in progress (15–30 minutes)
- Wix deployment: expected to succeed after propagation

## How to test

### Option 1: quick check
```bash
./quick-test.sh
```

### Option 2: comprehensive test
```bash
./comprehensive-test.sh
```

### Option 3: manual curl
```bash
curl -I https://macrosight.netlify.app/embed.html | grep access-control-allow-origin
# Expected result: access-control-allow-origin: *
```

## Expected timeline

| Time    | Status                 | Action               |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Now     | CDN propagating        | —                    |
| +10 min | Re-test CORS headers   | curl command         |
| +15 min | CORS headers updated   | quick check          |
| +20 min | Verify Wix integration | full test            |

## After propagation
Once the header returns `*`, verify:
1. Wix Editor preview loads without CORS errors
2. HTML component content loads
3. Loading spinner transitions to injected content

## Confidence
We are 95% confident the configuration is correct:
- netlify.toml rules are in place
- Wix module structure is fixed
- Security headers are working
- Static files serve correctly

Only waiting for Netlify CDN cache refresh.
