          <h2>My Journey in Technology</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
            Over the past <strong>15+ years</strong>, I've had the privilege of building and scaling technology across the entire spectrum‚Äîfrom individual contributor to strategic technology leader. My journey began with a Computer Science degree from the University of Washington, where I fell in love with distributed systems and the challenges of building software at scale.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
            What drives me isn't just the technology itself, but the <strong>human element</strong>‚Äîbuilding teams that can tackle complex problems, creating architectures that empower businesses to grow, and mentoring the next generation of technology leaders. I believe the best technology solutions emerge from diverse, collaborative teams who understand both the technical and business challenges they're solving.
