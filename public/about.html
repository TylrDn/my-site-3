          <h2>My Journey in Technology</h2>
          <p class="narrative-text">
            Over the past <strong>6+ years</strong>, I've had the privilege of
            building and scaling technology across diverse environments—from
            high-voltage electrical systems to cutting-edge cloud
            infrastructures. My journey began with a degree in Integrated
            Science & Technology from James Madison University, where I
            discovered my passion for bridging traditional engineering with
            emerging technologies.
          </p>
          <p class="narrative-text">
            What drives me is the intersection of
            <strong>critical infrastructure and innovation</strong>—building
            systems that not only perform reliably but adapt and scale with
            business needs. From managing transmission substations at Dominion
            Energy to architecting HPC clusters for AI/ML workloads, I bring a
            unique perspective that values both operational excellence and
            technological advancement.

          <div class="expertise-card">
            <div class="expertise-icon">[Systems]</div>
            <h3>Systems Thinking</h3>
            <p>
              Every technical decision should consider the broader system
              impact. I focus on building solutions that integrate seamlessly
              across traditional and modern infrastructures.

            <p>
              Technology evolves rapidly. I champion learning cultures,
              experimentation with emerging tools, and staying ahead of industry
              trends to maintain competitive advantages.

            <h3>Operational Excellence</h3>
            <p>
              Reliability is paramount. I design for 99.9% uptime, implement
              robust monitoring, and create systems that fail gracefully and
              recover automatically.
