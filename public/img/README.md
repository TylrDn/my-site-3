### Headshot

- `headshot.jpg`: Standard resolution (e.g., 400x400)
- `headshot@2x.jpg`: Double-resolution version for high-DPI displays
- `headshot.webp`: Optional WebP version for modern browsers
- `headshot@2x.webp`: Optional double-resolution WebP

Upload your headshot files with these exact names to ensure the home page's `<picture>` element embeds them correctly. Additional images can also be added here and referenced in pages via `/img/<filename>` paths.
