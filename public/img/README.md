This directory stores images served by the site.

### Headshot

- `headshot.jpg`: Standard resolution (e.g., 400x400)
- `headshot@2x.jpg`: Double-resolution version for high-DPI displays

Replace these placeholder files with your own headshot while keeping the same filenames. Additional images can also be added here and referenced in pages via `/img/<filename>` paths.
